<h2>CNC Mill</h2>
<p>The CNC Mill caused many difficulties for me. The first time I tried using the mill the mill went straight down and immediately stopped. I later learned that this is because a part of the mill touched the top of the wax and that is not supposed to happen. To solve this problem, a part of the top mold was cut off in Fusion360. The next time issue I tried using the mill, the process I actually worked but the starting point was to close to the edge of the wax, and part of the mold ended up getting cut off. I switched to a new block of wax and started the program again. Some more issues were caused by the mill being too close to the wax. This was solved by adjusting the height of the mill and giving more space between it and the block of wax. After many excruciating hours, I finally got my result.</p>

<h2>Molding</h2>
<p>I decided to use both a 3D-printed positive and a wax positive because I was not sure how well the ring would turn out with each. The molding part was fairly easy. I ended up trying both sorta-clear and oomoo. Sorta-clear gave me a much cleaner and prettier mold that still had most of the details of the ring albeit still.</p>

<h2>Casting</h2>
<p>Casting the ring was more difficult than I had anticipated. At first, the toaster oven had issues heating up, this was solved by increasing the temperature of this setting. Then, pouring the metal was also very difficult because it wouldnâ€™t settle into the mold correctly, it would pour everywhere, and then immediately solidify. After three tries, I ended up with a result that was satisfactory. The ring was missing a lot of details and ended up breaking at one point. However, I do plan on trying this again to get a cleaner result.</p>
