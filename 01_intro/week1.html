Week 1: Introduction & Documentation

For my first week in PHYS S-12: Introduction to Digital Fabrication, we went over class fundamentals, past final projects, and then worked on brainstorming for our final project. Additionally, I created my own website. I am very excited to learn more about the process of creating an aesthetically pleasing website along with the code that makes it run smoothly.

Final Project Proposal

Many people do not buy plants because they think that they are too difficult to maintain. While this is true for some plants, most can thrive with just a little bit of extra care. For my final project, I would like to create a Plant Supply Dispensing Machine. This machine will hopefully help people new to gardening feel less scared to try as they will not have to do as much work. This project will most likely use a soil pH sensor, a sensor to detect water levels in the soil, three dispensers, three connectable dispensing cups, two types of liquid fertilizer, water, and a potted plant. One dispenser would contain water, one dispenser would contain liquid nitrogen fertilizer, and one dispenser would contain liquid potassium fertilizer. First, both of the sensors (water and pH) would measure their respective levels. Based on the given measurements, the dispensers would release a certain amount of water or liquid fertilizer into the dispensing cups. The user can then pour the content of the dispensing cups onto the soil surrounding the plant.
