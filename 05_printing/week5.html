<h2>Scanning</h2>
<p>For my scanning project, my first idea was to borrow a small frog charm from one of my friends. However, since the object was so small, the scanner ahd difficult sensing where it was. So, I decided to switch to a much larger object. This was my computer mouse. It took roughly two tries to get a clean scan. This was because the first time the scanner for some reason started to replicate the shape of the object on top of the original scan when the object went around on the pedestal again.. During the second scan, I made sure to stop it as soon as it full scanned the object. In the RevoStudio, I used the fill tool to fill the gaps, and then I used the smooth tool to get rid of the jagged edges and make the mouse look more realistic.</p>
