<h1>3D Design, Printing, Scanning</h1>

<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>For my 3D printer project, I printed out two componenets for my final project. I used one componenet that I found online, and one component I designed myself. The componenet online was a ml measuring cup for the liquids that will be released by my vending machines. The component that I designed myself was a mini watering pot with a spout to mix the fertilizers and pour them onto the plant.</p>

<h3>Watering Pot Design Process</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The main shape of the cup was created using a 120 mm circle that was then extruded 120 mm. Then a hole 115 mm wide and 115 mm deep was placed with the origin being at the center of the circle.<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QZNWvRQ5intO6demcJY_IlphHj_ppd8UrWYcC4AM1SDAPB6eamck3uY1MRKRV54aHj3miUI94c29MjOtBAcGu4goVYCNWX-1vvcBIcch5vnMix_EudbDi2bN_U5gqlnG01emA6EuQMEquRScrIS_DMI" alt="Base"width="640" height="360"></li>
  <li>Create another cylinder that is 20 mm wide and 110 mm tall. Add a whole that 18 mm by 110 mm.<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MRb3kUkuqcplUfnxoaiArZ5zPKpBzvaK9yZ6E6GMHrQjo4ksn_fYBaKeGDFjywPZnYdjyM0T_ob61yJr_iO2T3mUUljMA4a38hoQUOypLvVBBD1NwwfWfe2jJpUPEP5OPX1I6rpSx3qEVCJrTdFUjEw" alt="Spout"width="640" height="360"></li>
  <li>Use the move tool to move the spout into the can. Then use the combine tool to combine the two bodies.<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7DXWaBdqzG212hgumzhbQQJdadIxkOj7fzu_T8Hwn4IMG_QPabRQhCP_ort6m80JvB6_834cwkjk6fbJq7qSJyC3cuZyRCtDBsGYwPcko3tkO4NBXuxpya0g7z9C1R58sqPKTRpKBfXxFNtDosKuTms" alt="Final"width="640" height="360"></li>
</ol>

<h3>Preparing the Files for the 3D Printer</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Download the files for the Measuring Cup by rickbear on Thingiverse: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3729442">Measuring Cup</a>(only for the measuring cup)</li>
  <li>Import the stl file to Fusion360</li>
  <li>Right-click the file under body and save it as a mesh (stl-binary)</li>
  <li>Open PrusaSlicer and import the file</li>
  <li>Make any modifications needed to the file</li>
  <li>Export as G-code to a SD card</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scanning</h2>
<p>For my scanning project, my first idea was to borrow a small frog charm from one of my friends. However, since the object was so small, the scanner had difficult sensing where it was. So, I decided to switch to a much larger object. This was my computer mouse. It took roughly two tries to get a clean scan. On my first try, the scanner started to replicate the shape of the object on top of the original scan when the object went around on the pedestal again. During the second scan, I made sure to stop it as soon as it full scanned the object. In the RevoStudio, I used the fill tool to fill the gaps, and then I used the smooth tool to get rid of the jagged edges and make the mouse look more realistic.</p>
