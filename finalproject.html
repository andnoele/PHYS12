<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

<img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/houseplant-background-plant-lovers_53876-130004.jpg?w=1060&t=st=1687395507~exp=1687396107~hmac=20ff538528442e205d2cfc374777d22fa18f6befb7e74ea389f8a8efff284db0" alt="plant banner">

Many people do not buy plants because they think that they are too difficult to maintain. While this is true for some plants, most can thrive with just a little bit of extra care. For my final project, I would like to create a Plant Supply Dispensing Machine. This machine will hopefully help people new to gardening feel less scared to try as they will not have to do as much work. This project will most likely use a soil pH sensor, a sensor to detect water levels in the soil, three dispensers, three connectable dispensing cups, two types of liquid fertilizer, water, and a potted plant. One dispenser would contain water, one dispenser would contain liquid nitrogen fertilizer, and one dispenser would contain liquid potassium fertilizer. First, both of the sensors(water and pH) would measure their respective levels. Based on the given measurements, the dispensers (with holes to release liquid) would release a certain amount of water or liquid fertilizer into the dispensing cups. The user can then pour the content of the dispensing cups onto the soil surrounding the plant.

<h2><u>Proposed Supplies</u></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Plant pH Sensor</li>
  <li>3 Dispensers (most likely 3D printed)</li>
  <li>3 Dispensing Cups (most likely 3D printed)</li>
  <li>Liquid Nitrogen Fertilizer</li>
  <li>Liquid Potassium Fertilizer</li>
  <li>Potted Plant (possibly dying)</li>
  <li>Microcontrollers</li>
</ul> 


<h2>Functionality</h2>

<p>
  For this to be successful, I would have to figure out a way to determine how much water or fertilizers would be released. This would require me to do some research on the correct amount to add for plants. Then I would have to create a program that would cause the dispensers (most likely controlled by microcontrollers) to release the correct amount of liquid. I have been taking inspiration from 3D printed gumball dispensers on the internet. Some of these are shown and linked below. I have also taken inspiration for my dispenser cups on the internet and these are also shown and linked below. The dispenser cups are most likely going to be a mix of the shape of a very long, skinny tray with high ends and the shape of a normal watering can. One of my ideas for this is to create a series of mini watering cans that can be linked together but also be taken apart.

<h2>Weekly Updates</h2>
<h3>Week of July 10</h3>
<p>
  The current idea for how the machine will operate is that when you push the button on the vending machine, the liquid it holds will be released. You will use the cups to measure how much liquid is released. A computer program will tell you how much liquid you need to release. Then, you will pour the liquid in the cup into a watering pot and then pour that onto the plant. This week I worked on my cups for the liquid. I used a measuring cup that was designed by somebody on Thingiverse because my attempt to design one myself was not successful. However, I designed the watering pot myself in Fusion360. Both items began printing on July 10 (See Week 5 Page for Details).
